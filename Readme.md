# Node Slideshow

## NOTE: Currently in Pre-Alpha

### Description

Node Slideshow is a lightweight system build using Node.js, express and socket.io,
it aims to be easy to use, easy to customize and fast!

### Project Ideas

My goal with this project is to create ready packaged barebones for a real time slideshow system. A user will
easily be able to create a new room, this room can be set to public or private, it can the be shared. The room is
essentially an online slideshow, when the room admin (slideshow presenter / owner) changes a slide, this action
will be mirrored to all connected users, giving it a real time feel to users in the room or in another country. 

### How It Works

* User creates new room
* User is admin of new room, has options to customise
* Once a room is set-up, it can be shared with a unique ID
* When users connect the Admin will be able to see via the Admin Page
* The user will now see the slideshow page
* When the admin changes a slide then the user will see this change in real time in their browser

### Road-Map

The project is currently in pre-alpha stage, therefore there is no system. When the project reaches Alpha
it will be usable. Here is a list of current work;

* Directory Structure
* Basic authentication (for room admin)
* Customization page
* Search page
* All online rooms page
